# Ants
A fun little ant simulation project.

Currently this is a simple terminal app. Running it will display a 10x10 grid with with 5 numbered ants placed randomly on it. Progressing the simulation will show the ants randomly wandering around the grid.

Inputs:
'x' or 'X': quit
'c' or 'X': print number of ants
anything else: progress simulation
